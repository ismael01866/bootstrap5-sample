## 1. Requirements

The boilerplate needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system.
It was tested with version 16 and newer.

## 2. Quick Start

1. Clone the repository into a new folder for your new project.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ismael01866/html-webpack-boilerplate.git new-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Run webpack

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command tells webpack to run in production mode and compiles all of the assets in a minified version, ready to be delivered as production assets.
